# 🏡 IwacuAI  
**AI for Predicting and Preventing Homelessness**

---

## 🌍 Overview
**IwacuAI** (meaning *“Home”* in Kinyarwanda) is an artificial intelligence system designed to **predict and prevent homelessness** by analyzing socioeconomic, health, and housing data.  

The model identifies individuals and families at risk of losing their homes before the crisis occurs — empowering governments, NGOs, and social service organizations to take *proactive action*.  

IwacuAI represents a vision for how AI can serve humanity — by ensuring every person has a place to call home.

## 💡 Inspiration
Homelessness remains a growing issue across the world — often invisible until it’s too late.  
In Africa, many families live on the edge due to unemployment, rising rent, and limited access to social protection.  

IwacuAI uses machine learning to *forecast vulnerability* and *suggest interventions* such as financial aid, mental health support, or employment opportunities.
