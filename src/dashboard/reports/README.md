# 🏡 IwacuAI  
**AI for Predicting and Preventing Homelessness**

---

## 🌍 Overview
**IwacuAI** (meaning *“Home”* in Kinyarwanda) is an artificial intelligence system designed to **predict and prevent homelessness** by analyzing socioeconomic, health, and housing data.  

The model identifies individuals and families at risk of losing their homes before the crisis occurs — empowering governments, NGOs, and social service organizations to take *proactive action*.  

IwacuAI represents a vision for how AI can serve humanity — by ensuring every person has a place to call home.  

---

## 💡 Inspiration
Homelessness remains a growing issue across the world — often invisible until it’s too late.  
In Africa, many families live on the edge due to unemployment, rising rent, and limited access to social protection.  

IwacuAI uses machine learning to *forecast vulnerability* and *suggest interventions* such as financial aid, mental health support, or employment opportunities.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict the **likelihood of homelessness** based on historical data  
- Identify the **key social and economic risk factors**  
- Provide **visual insights** to policymakers and humanitarian organizations  
- Promote **ethical and fair AI** decision-making for social good

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit / Power BI  
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Version Control:** GitHub

---2️⃣ Install Dependencies

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/IwacuAI.git
cd IwacuAI

pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Model Notebook

Open and run the training notebook in notebooks/ using Jupyter or Google Colab.

4️⃣ Launch the Dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/app.py

🧠 Model Workflow

Data Cleaning: handle missing values, normalize inputs

Feature Engineering: create indicators (income ratio, rent burden, etc.)

Model Training: use XGBoost or AutoML for prediction

Evaluation: measure precision, recall, and fairness

Explainability: use SHAP to visualize feature importance

Visualization: build interactive dashboard

📈 Expected Outcomes

Predictive model that estimates the risk of homelessness

Dashboard showing insights by district, age, income, or education level

AI-driven recommendations for early intervention

🧭 Ethical Considerations

IwacuAI is guided by ethical AI principles:

Fairness: no bias against gender, age, or region

Transparency: explainable predictions (SHAP values)

Privacy: anonymized and secure datasets

Human-centered design: AI assists — it never replaces — social workers

🤝 Collaboration & Future Work

In the future, IwacuAI aims to integrate with:

Government social service databases

Mobile data collection tools for rural communities

Partner NGOs working on social housing programs

Potential expansion into mental health, unemployment, and financial vulnerability prediction.
